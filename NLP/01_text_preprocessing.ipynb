Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick.

forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.<br /><br />it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":415}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **2.

forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":420}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **3.

forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":423}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **4.

schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show yet while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like the day the earth stood still the incredible shrinking man invasion of the body snatchers war of the worlds and the thing from another world yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly mgms first big foray into a level science fiction forbidden planet released in 1956 it was a 98 minute color film directed by fred m wilcox that featured then state of the art special effects and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume from a screen treatment called fatal planet by irving block and allen adler who adapted aspects of william shakespeares the tempest into itthe film drew raves when it was released for its oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by louis and bebe barron although credited as electronic tonalities to avoid music guild fees vivid matte paintings inspired by chesley bonestell and the famed monster of the id moti which was animated by an animator joshua meador on loan from the walt disney studio even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot in his first role in either film or television later he would appear in the film the invisible boy included in this dvd as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone night gallery and lost in space with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlinsthe tale is simple but elegantly constructed and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced love story aspect in the film in the 23rd century the united planets cruiser c57d a flying saucer led by commander jj adams leslie nielsen yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days is en route to the planet altair iv to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon sent to the planet twenty years earlier after a years journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party doctor edward morbius walter pidgeon the prospero standin a philologist his gorgeous blond daughter altaira anne francis the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt and robby the robot the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year yet he was immune to it\\u0085 all in all its a technically good film especially with some rear projections and matte paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmys and robbys exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity yet its manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures for its played straight thus making it even funnier as for the main feature forbidden planet deserves all its kudos its not a perfect film but its a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than star wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile only such films like 2001 a space odyssey solaris alien and aliens and the first two terminator films have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effectsits worth knowing that despite forbidden planets happy ending there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta as well after all she is her fathers daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time also the film wisely only shows the moti once and never shows the krel for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy but even if you dont theres still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping that alone

schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show yet while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like the day the earth stood still the incredible shrinking man invasion of the body snatchers war of the worlds and the thing from another world yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly mgms first big foray into a level science fiction forbidden planet released in 1956 it was a 98 minute color film directed by fred m wilcox that featured then state of the art special effects and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume from a screen treatment called fatal planet by irving block and allen adler who adapted aspects of william shakespeares the tempest into itthe film drew raves when it was released for its oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by louis and bebe barron although credited as electronic tonalities to avoid music guild fees vivid matte paintings inspired by chesley bonestell and the famed monster of the id moti which was animated by an animator joshua meador on loan from the walt disney studio even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot in his first role in either film or television later he would appear in the film the invisible boy included in this dvd as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone night gallery and lost in space with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlinsthe tale is simple but elegantly constructed and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced love story aspect in the film in the 23rd century the united planets cruiser c57d a flying saucer led by commander jj adams leslie nielsen yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days is en route to the planet altair iv to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon sent to the planet twenty years earlier after a years journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party doctor edward morbius walter pidgeon the prospero standin a philologist his gorgeous blond daughter altaira anne francis the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt and robby the robot the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year yet he was immune to it all in all its a technically good film especially with some rear projections and matte paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmys and robbys exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity yet its manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures for its played straight thus making it even funnier as for the main feature forbidden planet deserves all its kudos its not a perfect film but its a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than star wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile only such films like 2001 a space odyssey solaris alien and aliens and the first two terminator films have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effectsits worth knowing that despite forbidden planets happy ending there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta as well after all she is her fathers daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time also the film wisely only shows the moti once and never shows the krel for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy but even if you dont theres still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping that alone is timeless\"\n
