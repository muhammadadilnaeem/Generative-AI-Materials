# **Medical Chatbot Assistant**

This project is a **Medical Chatbot Assistant** designed to provide basic health-related information, symptom checks, and medical advice based on user input. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a custom-trained machine learning model to interact with users in a conversational format.

## **Features**

- **Symptom Checker**: Users can describe their symptoms, and the chatbot provides possible conditions and recommendations.
- **Medical Advice**: The chatbot can offer advice on common medical queries, providing information on treatments, medications, and best practices.
- **Conversational Interface**: A user-friendly interface that engages in natural language conversations to enhance user experience.
- **AI-powered**: Uses machine learning models for analyzing medical data and providing accurate responses.
- **Scalable**: Can be further trained or fine-tuned with additional data to cover more medical conditions or improve accuracy.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Language Model**: GPT-based or similar pre-trained NLP model.
- **Framework**: LangChain for chaining and managing conversational flows.
- **Database**: Chroma for storing and retrieving medical records and embeddings.
- **Backend**: Python for server-side logic and model integration.
- **Deployment**: FastAPI or Flask for web service, with Docker for containerization.

## **Installation**

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadadilnaeem/Generative-AI-Materials.git
   cd Generative-AI-Materials/Generative%20AI%20Mini%20Projects/01_medical_chatbot_assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## **Usage**

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port) to interact with the Medical Chatbot.

Enter your symptoms or medical query, and the chatbot will respond with relevant advice or information.
